A webapp that contains a timer and a stopwatch (i.e., a countdown and a countup).  Written using [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) (including [Glyphicons](http://glyphicons.com/)).

Includes an input field where the user can specify the amount of time to count up/down to.
The stopwatch and timer have independent controls (play, pause, reset), and are disabled when they reach their target.
